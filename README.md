# SICP Exercise Implementations

My implementation of exercises from the classic book

> **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Progams**
> by - Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman

### Interested in playing around?

_I make the assumption that you have scheme installed locally, or running via docker (with volumes)_

- Ensure you're in the cloned repo folder i.e `cd sicp-exercises`
- Start your scheme REPL (or run via docker container with volume setup to your current directory)
- Run `(load "/path/to/exercises/exercise-{x.x}")`. Solid example below to execute `exercise-1.2`, 
  * `(load "exercise-1.2")`
  * `run`

__Note__: I use `run` in each exercise file as the general command to execute the solution that prints the final output/answer to the exercise.
