Exercise 1.3: Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments
and returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers.
|#

(define (gte a b)
  (>= a b)  
)

(define (square a)
  (* a a)
)

(define (max a b)
  (if (gte a b)
    a
    b
  )
)

(define (run a b c)
  (if (gte a b)
    (+ (square a) (square (max b c)))
    (+ (square b) (square (max a c)))
  )
)
